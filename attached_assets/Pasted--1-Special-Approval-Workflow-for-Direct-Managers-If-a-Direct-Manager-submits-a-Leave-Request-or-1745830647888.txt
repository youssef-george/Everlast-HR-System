🛠️ 1. Special Approval Workflow for Direct Managers:
If a Direct Manager submits a Leave Request or a Permission Request, it should only require approval from the Account Manager (Admin).

It should NOT require approval from higher managers like Company Director.

Approval Flow:

Normal Employee:

Leave Request: Direct Manager → Account Manager

Permission Request: Direct Manager → Company Director → Account Manager

Direct Manager:

Leave Request: Direct → Account Manager

Permission Request: Direct → Account Manager

➕ 2. Admin Ability to Create Requests for Any Employee:
Admin can create Leave or Permission requests on behalf of any employee.

Admin selects employee from a searchable dropdown (name or email).

Request is inserted into the normal workflow based on employee role.

Employee should receive a notification that a request was submitted for them.

Admin can edit or cancel any request they created.

👨‍💼 3. Direct Manager Account Enhancements:
A user assigned as Direct Manager should:

See their own leave and permission requests clearly in their dashboard.

See the leave and permission requests of their team members grouped and listed separately.

📅 4. Calendar View per Role:
Direct Managers should have a calendar showing:

Their own requests (leave and permissions).

Their team members' requests (in the same calendar view, color-coded if possible).

Normal employees see only their own requests.

Company Director and Admin see all requests across the company.

🧩 5. Admin Role Behavior:
Account Manager (Admin) is the Super Admin.

Admin users:

Can view everything across all departments.

Can approve or reject any request at any stage.

Multiple Admins are allowed (role-based assignment).

The default Admin account should be:

Username: admin

Password: Admin@123

🎨 6. UI/UX Requirements:
Application design must use Metronic UI style (professional, modern UI and UX).

Sidebar should be on the left instead of top bar.

Colors should be:

Primary Color: #005d99

Secondary Color: #17a74a

Tertiary Color: #006e94

The entire UI/UX should be clean, responsive, and fully in English (no Arabic texts or background issues).

🛠️ 7. Critical Bugs to Fix:
Department Analytics and Request Status Overview are not working in the Admin Dashboard — needs fixing.

In the Department List under the Manager column:

Even if managers are assigned to departments, the system shows "No Manager Assigned" — this must be fixed.

✅ Please follow clean code practices, organized database structure, and professional UI/UX standards. ✅ Prioritize real-time updating of the dashboard and calendars where possible.
