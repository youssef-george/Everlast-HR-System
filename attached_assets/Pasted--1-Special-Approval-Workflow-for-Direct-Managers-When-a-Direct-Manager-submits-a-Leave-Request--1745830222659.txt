🛠️ 1. Special Approval Workflow for Direct Managers:
When a Direct Manager submits a Leave Request or a Permission Request:

✅ It should only require approval from the Account Manager (Admin).

❌ It should not require any approval from any other manager (like Company Director).

Approval Flows Summary:

Normal Employee:

Leave Request: Direct Manager → Account Manager

Permission Request: Direct Manager → Company Director → Account Manager

Direct Manager (Special Rule):

Leave Request: Direct → Account Manager only

Permission Request: Direct → Account Manager only

➕ 2. Admin Ability to Create Requests for Employees:
Account Manager (Admin) can create Leave Requests and Permission Requests on behalf of any employee in the company.

Admin should be able to:

Select an employee from a searchable dropdown (by name or email).

Fill all necessary request fields (dates, reason, etc.).

Submit the request following the normal approval flow based on the employee’s role.

After submission:

The employee gets notified about the created request.

Admin has the right to edit or cancel any request they created.

👨‍💼 3. Direct Manager Account View Enhancements:
Any user who holds the Direct Manager role should:

See their own personal requests (leaves and permissions) in their account dashboard clearly.

See their team’s requests in a separate section under their dashboard (organized by employee).

📅 4. Direct Manager Calendar View:
In the calendar view for any Direct Manager:

The calendar must show:

All of their own personal requests (leaves and permissions).

All requests of employees in their assigned department/team (filtered and color-coded if possible).

This makes it easy for Direct Managers to monitor:

Their team's attendance behavior (leaves and permissions trends).

Their personal activities at the same time.

✅ Summary of Key Improvements:

Smarter approval flow based on roles.

Admin full flexibility to manage requests.

Direct Manager full visibility on both personal and team requests.

Calendar highly personalized per role.

Improved transparency and tracking across the system.
